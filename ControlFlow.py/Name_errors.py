# NameError occurs if a variable is used before it has been assigned a value or if a variable name is spelled differently than the point at which it was defined
# Some common name errors are:
# Misspelling a variable name.
# Forgetting to define a variable.

# variable1 = defined 
# variable2 =
# this will give a name error because variable 2 is undefined
# print(variable2)

# prin("variable1")
# this will give name error because print is misspelled
