# 'True' and 'False' are their own special type: bool
# Boolean variables can be created in several ways. The easiest way is to simply assign True or False to a variable:
# Boolean values 'True' and 'False' always need to be capitalized and do not have quotation marks.

set_to_true = True
set_to_false = False

# You can also set a variable equal to a boolean expression.

bool_one = 5 != 7 
bool_two = 1 + 1 != 2
bool_three = 3 * 3 == 9

#These variables now contain boolean values, so when you reference them they will only return the 'True' or 'False' values of the expression they were assigned
