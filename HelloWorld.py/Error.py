# Syntax error happens when there is something wrong with the way your program is written (spelling, punctuation, etc)
# Name error happens when the python is unable to identify the name (usually happens when variables are left unassigned)

# print(hi) # This will show as a name error, because hi is not defined. To define hi it needs to be surrounded by quotation marks 
# print("This message starts with a double quote and ends with a single quote') # This will show as syntax error
