# String is a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, whitespace, or punctuation) enclosed by quotation marks.
# In Python a string is either surrounded by double quotes ("Hello world") or single quotes ('Hello world')
# If a string has to be broken into multiple lines, the \ can be used to indicate that the string continues on the next line
